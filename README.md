## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://code.ovgu.de/ghosal/shieldx.git

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

# NAME

SHIELDX for Everyone's Safety.

## Description

The vision of developing this application is to provide a sense of security for people travelling in their daily life. The purpose is to make it easy to use and widely available for customers who travel alone and want their family and friends to track them whenever they wish. 
ShieldX makes sure to keep you safe and secure by notifying your current location status to your friends and family throughout your journey. 

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Language For Business Logics

```Javascript```

## Language For UI

```xmls```


## License
ShieldX is an android application developed by students of Otto-von Guericke University, Magdeburg in June 2022 as the part of their course project of Introduction to software engineering for engineers under the supervision of Professor Christian Braune.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.


## Project status
We have completed our project considering the semester project deadline 05.07.2022
