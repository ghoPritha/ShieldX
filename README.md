ShieldX is an android application developed by students of Otto-von Guericke University, Magdeburg in June 2022 as the part of their course project of Introduction to software engineering for engineers under the supervision of Professor Christian Braune.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
